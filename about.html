    <div class="panel-title">FROM PANDEMIC TO INFODEMIC</div>
    <p>Why sharing unsupervised information has become such a huge problem to the point that social platforms had to take action against it? This online behavior fells under the much wider phenomenon of “infodemic”.
    <br>
    <br>
    The World Health Organisation defines 'infodemic' as the dissemination of false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak. When users share this type of content, it can confuse and induce health-damaging behaviour. It also leads to distrust of health authorities and undermines the public health response. An infodemic can intensify or lengthen epidemics when people are unsure of what they need to do to protect their health and the health of those around them.
    <br>
    <br>
    With growing digitization – an expansion of social media and internet use – information can spread more rapidly. Given that more than three billion individuals use social media regularly, and for prolonged periods, it becomes the primary source of information and communication, especially during a crisis, irrespective of the authenticity of the sources. This can help to more quickly fill information voids but can also amplify harmful messages.
    <br>
    <br>
    The fear of an “unknown” illness without a definitive cure creates uncertainty, leading to anxiety and increased sharing of misinformation, unaware of the sources. Thus any senseless forward of a message, meme or video can snowball the effect, if in the wrong hands. This epidemic of “shared misinformation” has become rampant during the Covid-19 pandemic, spreading faster than the virus itself.

    <div class="panel-title">PROJECT</div>
    <p>“...” is a project developed during the Final Synthesis Lab of Communication Design MSc at Politecnico di Milano. It is a recorded journey of the investigation in which we analyzed, through seven different paths, how easily one can lose himself in the cloud of misinformation, landing on disturbing content, even when starting from something neutral. The project is addressed to the general user of the internet, digitally educated, but can stumble, like everyone else, on some kind of uninformative content. What happens next?
    <br>
    <br>
    The project is an extension of the previous report 'Among the plandemic truthers. A data journey through the infodemic conspiracists underground', a study of how content related to Covid-19, from general misinformation to outright conspiracy theories, is communicated on 'dark platforms', social websites that are less regulated and moderated. From the 'Bitchute' platform, our team studied the connections between hashtags* and videos, analyzing how easily they are linked together to create a fluid cloud of misinformation without rigid distinctions.
    <br>
    <br>
    For “...”, we selected seven neutral hashtags, from those that emerged from the research, and from there we collected videos that we then ranked in order from those that we classified as more neutral to those that were more violent, bizarre or connoted.
    The website consists of a series of seven thematic pages that are meant to highlight the different degree of content that we found for each specific hashtag during our research about dark platforms and the theme of infodemics.
    The seven hashtags will act as ‘entry points’ and will lead the user down the rabbit hole of misinformation.
    <br>
    <br>
    *on each bitchute video the user can add hashtags. Usually, there are 3 or 4 per video. The algorithm uses this information (plus many others) to link to related video to keep the user engaged.

    <div class="panel-title">ARCHIVE</div>
    <p>The clips shown in the thematic pages were taken from a wider network that serves as an archive for our website. The purpose of the archive is to allow the user to explore our entire dataset and see for themselves how the videos linked to a single hashtag are connected. Through the archive, it is possible for the user to dive deep into the network, starting with a single hashtag and looking where it leads you.
